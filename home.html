    What is the history of car?
</h1>

<p id="his">The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
    Cars became widely available during the 20th century. 
    One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.</p>

<h1>Why cars are made?</h1>

<p id="his">There are dozens of different reasons behind the invention of cars. 
    The main sources of these reasons are facilitating the transportation of people, enabling them to reach another place more easily. 
    In addition to transportation, the car has become a frequently used product in the military sense.</p>
